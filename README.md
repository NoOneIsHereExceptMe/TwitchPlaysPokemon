# How to Register an App in Twitch [Same as the [Offcial Twitch Instructions](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/register-app/) but optimised for this bot]
- The first step to getting an access token is to register your application (this includes any kind of Twitch bots). To register an application:
  - Log in to the [developer console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console) using your Twitch account. If you don‚Äôt have an account, select the Sign Up tab to create one.
    - When you sign up for an account, Twitch sends you an email to verify your account. Be sure to open the email and verify your account before proceeding.
    - You must also enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your account. To enable 2FA, navigate to Security and Privacy, and follow the steps for enabling 2FA under the Security section.
    - You‚Äôll need to refresh your console for these changes to take effect.
  - Select the Applications tab on the developer console and then click Register Your Application.
  - Set Name to your application‚Äôs name. [The name must be unique among all Twitch applications, if uou make one yourself] Your app‚Äôs name is listed on the [Connections](https://www.twitch.tv/settings/security) page under Other Connections if your app requires user consent to access or modify the user‚Äôs resources.
  - Set OAuth Redirect URLs to the callback URL that your app uses for authorizations. [Use this URL: ```http://localhost:17563```]
  - After adding your redirect URL, click Add
  - Select a Category (type of application) that your app belongs to.
  - Click the I‚Äôm not a robot checkbox.
  - Back in the Applications tab, and if eneything went right you should be able to locate your app under Developer Applications.

# IMPORTANT NOTE
***Treat client secrets and any kind of Tokens as you would your password. You must keep it confidential and never expose it to anyone, even in an obscured form.***

***I DO NOT own any of the rom files provided in the repository. They all are made by Nintendo. (Please don't sue me Nintendo ‡≤•‚Å†‚Äø‚Å†‡≤• )***
